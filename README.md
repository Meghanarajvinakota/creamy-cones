# Creamy Cones

Creamy Cones is a famous icecream store that wants to expand their already successful business onto the online market. 

Therefore I have built a programme which allows the user to place an order online which gives Creamy Cones another avenue of making money.

This fully python written programme is run on a mock terminal.
